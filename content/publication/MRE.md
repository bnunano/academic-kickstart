abstract = "How to remove radionuclides from radioactive wastewater has long been a difficult problem, especially in nuclear accidents. In this paper, the adsorption of radionuclides Cs, Sr, and Ba on the monolayer MoS2 was investigated by using the first principles calculation method. Through the calculation of adsorption energy and Hirshfeld charge of the radionuclides on the monolayer MoS2 at six adsorption sites, the results show that all of the radionuclides chemisorbed on the monolayer MoS2, and the adsorption strength of these three kinds of radionuclides on the monolayer MoS2 is Ba>Sr>Cs. This work might shed some light on the treatment of the radioactive wastewater."
